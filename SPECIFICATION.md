# System Specification Document

## Introduction

### Project Title
**Event Booking System**
Name of the booking system: **Event Hub**

### Domain
**Event Management**
The system operates within the event management domain, providing a digital solution for users to browse, book, and manage event tickets. It helps event organisers manage bookings efficiently.

### Problem Statement
Managing event bookings manually can be inconvenient for both event organisers and attendees. Issues such as overbooking, lack of real-time availability updates, and difficulties in tracking reservations make the process inefficient. The **Event Booking System – Event Hub** aims to solve these problems by offering a centralised, automated platform where users can seamlessly book tickets, and organisers can manage event details.

### Individual Scope
The feasibility of the **Event Booking System – Event Hub** is justified based on the following:
- **Scalability**: The system can be adapted for different event types (concerts, talk shows, conferences, sports matches, workshops, etc.).
- **Automation**: Reduces human errors in event booking, tracking, and management.
- **User Convenience**: Provides a smooth and seamless experience for attendees, allowing online reservations and cancellations.
- **Market Demand**: An online event booking system aligns with current industry trends and user expectations regarding digitization of services.
- **Technology Feasibility**: The system can be implemented using existing web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the frontend, Python Flask for the backend, and MySQL for database management.
