# Kanban Board Setup and Explanation

## 1. Overview

A Kanban board is a visual workflow management tool that helps manage work by displaying tasks arranged in columns, where each column represents a different development stage of the process making it easy for teams to track workflow and identify bottlenecks and to see what needs to be done, whatâ€™s in progress, and whatâ€™s completed, making it easier to track workflow and identify bottlenecks.

My  GitHub **Kanban Board** was created to manage the development of the **Event Booking System (EventHub)**, following the **Sprint Plan** from Assignment 6.

## 2. Column Setup
The board was structured to align with Agile principles and the development workflow.

| Column Name | Purpose |
|-------------|---------|
| **Product Backlog** | Contains all user stories from the Product Backlog. |
| **Sprint Backlog** | Selected task/user stories that are prioritized for the current sprint. |
| **In Progress/Development** | Stories actively being developed. |
| **Testing & Review** | Stories that are completed but need code review, testing or approval. |
| **Done** | Completed user stories that have passed testing. |

## 3. Creating Labels for Issues
To categorize issues efficiently, the following labels were created in GitHub:

| Label Name | Color | Purpose |
|------------|-------|---------|
| **User Story** | ðŸŸ¢ `#28a745` | Identifies functional requirements from the backlog. |
| **Task** | ðŸ”µ `#00509e` | Represents a specific development task. |
| **Bug** | ðŸ”´ `#d73a4a` | Marks issues related to system errors or defects. |
| **Must-have** | ðŸ”µ `#0075ca` | High-priority user stories necessary for the MVP. |
| **Should-have** | ðŸŸ  `#ff9f1c` | Features that enhance usability but are not critical. |
| **Could-have** | ðŸŸ¡ `#ffcc00` | Low-priority features for future sprints. |
| **Frontend** | ðŸŸ¦ `#1E90FF` | Assigned to UI-related tasks. |
| **Backend** | ðŸŸ§ `#FFA500` | Assigned to API and database tasks. |
| **QA** | ðŸŸ© `#32CD32` | Assigned to testing tasks. |

### **How Labels Were Created:**
1. **Go to the GitHub Repository** â†’ Click **Issues** â†’ Click **Labels**.
2. Click **New Label** â†’ Enter the label name.
3. Choose a **color** for easy identification.
4. Click **Create Label**.
- **PLEASE NOTE: ** Custom Role-Based Labels were created to assign roles. 

## 4. Creating Issues for the Board
Each user story and task from the Sprint Plan was added as a GitHub **Issue**:

### **How Issues Were Created:**
1. **Go to the GitHub Repository** â†’ Click **Issues** â†’ Click **New Issue**.
2. **Title:** Use the **Story ID** from the backlog (e.g., `US-001 - Search for Events`).
3. **Description:** Include user story details and acceptance criteria.
4. **Labels:** Assign appropriate labels (`User Story`, `Task`, `Bug`, etc.).
5. **Milestone:** Assign to the correct sprint (e.g., `Sprint 1 - MVP Development`).
6. Click **Submit Issue**.

## 5. Assigning Tasks to Team Members using @Mentions
To simulate team assignments, dummy team members were referenced using `@mentions`:

| Issue ID | User Story | Role | Assigned Team Member (Dummy) |
|----------|-----------|------|--------------------------|
| **US-001** | Search for events by title, date, or location | Frontend Developer | @malibongwe-dywibiba (Frontend) | 
| **US-002** | View event details (description, venue, date, time) | Frontend Developer | @palesa-sello (Frontend) |
| **US-003** | Book a ticket for an event | Backend Developer | @faizel-snyders (Backend) |
| **US-004** | Receive a booking confirmation email | Backend Developer | @kim-oldjohn (Backend) |
| **US-005** | Create a new event with details | Backend Developer | @tania-andrews (Backend) |
| **US-006** | Edit and update event details | Backend Developer | @alfonso-basson (Backend) |
| **US-007** | View reports on ticket sales | QA Tester | @adam-behardien (QA) |
| **US-008** | Manage user accounts (create, update, disable) | Backend Developer | @wafeeka-bridgemohan (Backend) |
| **US-009** | Oversee payments and refunds | Backend Developer | @kyle-jessman (Backend) |
| **US-010** | Monitor system uptime and performance | QA Tester | @melinda-petersen (QA) |

### **How @Mentions Were Used Inside Issues**
To ensure each task had a clear owner, the following @mentions were added in the issue descriptions and comments.

### **Alternative: Assigning Labels Instead of Users**
Since GitHub does not allow assigning tasks to non-existing users, the **Frontend, Backend, and QA labels** were used to categorize tasks:
- **Frontend tasks** were labeled with `Frontend`.
- **Backend tasks** were labeled with `Backend`.
- **Testing tasks** were labeled with `QA`.


## 6. Linking Issues to the Board
1. **Go to the GitHub Project Board**.
2. Click **"+ Add cards"** (top-right corner).
3. Select the **Issues** created earlier.
4. Drag them to the **appropriate column** (Backlog, Sprint Backlog, etc.).

## 7. Linking the Board to Assignment 6
- **User Stories from the Product Backlog** were added to the **Backlog column**.
- **Tasks/User Stories from the Sprint Backlog** were added to the **Sprint Backlog**.
- **Sprint 1 Milestone, Sprint 2 Milestone, Sprint 3 Milestone and Sprint 4 Milestone** was created and assigned to selected stories.


## 8. Agile Workflow Implementation
- **Sprint Planning**: Stories are moved from **Backlog â†’ Ready**.
- **Development**: Active work moves from **Ready â†’ In Progress/Development**.
- **Testing & Review**: Completed work moves to **Testing & Review** for final testing.
- **Completion**: Approved stories are moved to **Done**.

## 9. Conclusion
The Kanban board ensures that all tasks from the **Sprint Plan** are properly tracked, allowing for efficient development and clear progress visibility. The integration of **labels, issues, and milestones** makes it easy to manage and execute the project using Agile principles.
