# Reflections for Assignment 5

## Introduction
Translating system requirements into structured use cases and test cases is a critical step in software development. However, for those new to the process, several challenges can arise. These challenges impact the accuracy, completeness, and effectiveness of the final system. This document explores key difficulties and strategies to overcome them.

## 1. Understanding the Level of Detail Needed
I was not sure what the appropriate level of detail for use cases and test cases which is where I struggled with. I tried to clarify by using step by step descriptions. 

## 2. Handling Alternative and Exception Flows

## Conclusion
Translating requirements into use cases and test cases requires careful planning and attention to detail. I do have an idea or some type of experience in creating use and test cases.
