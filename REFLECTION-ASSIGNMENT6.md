# Reflection on Agile Planning Challenges

## Introduction
Transitioning from traditional requirement gathering to Agile planning introduces several challenges. As the sole stakeholder in this assignment, I encountered difficulties in prioritising tasks, estimating effort, and aligning Agile methodology with system development.

## 1. Prioritisation Challenges
One of the biggest challenges was deciding which features should be included in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). While search and booking functionalities were essential, other features like reporting and system monitoring seemed important but not urgent. Using the **MoSCoW prioritization** method helped break down features into Must-have, Should-have, and Could-have categories. This ensured that implementation of the most critical functionalities can happen first. 

## 2. Effort Estimation Difficulties
Estimating effort in story points was a bit difficult since I had no prior data on development time for each task. I applied the **Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)** to assign story points, keeping estimates relative rather than absolute. For future iterations, tracking actual development time will help refine these estimates.


## 3. Balancing Technical vs. User-Centric Stories
Security and performance requirements (e.g., data encryption, handling 1000 concurrent users) are crucial but does not immediately add visible user value. To balance this, I included at least one **non-functional user story** in the backlog per sprint, ensuring security and performance improvements while focusing on user-facing features.

## 4. Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs
Since I play multiple roles (Product Owner, Developer, and Stakeholder), it was difficult to objectively validate priorities.I simulated stakeholder feedback by considering real-world concerns, such as user experience, system reliability, and ease of event management. 

## Conclusion
Despite these challenges, Agile planning provided a structured approach to feature development. Refining prioritisation, estimation, and balancing functional vs. technical stories will be key to improving future sprints.
