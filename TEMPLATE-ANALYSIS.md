# Template Analysis: Choosing a GitHub Project Template

## 1. Overview
GitHub provides different project templates for managing workflows. For the Event Booking System, I evaluated the available templates and selected the most suitable one which was the Kanban Board.

## 2. Comparison of GitHub Project Templates

| Template | Features | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Basic Kanban** | Simple columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) | Easy to use, minimal setup | Lacks advanced tracking features |
| **Automated Kanban** | Issues move automatically based on status changes | Reduces manual task movement | Can be restrictive if custom workflows are needed |
| **Automated Kanban with Reviews** | Includes review columns for better approval tracking | Useful for code review processes | More complex than needed for an event booking system |

## GitHub Project Templates Comparison

| Feature               | Basic Kanban               | Automated Kanban          | Scrum Board               |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Columns/Workflows** | To Do, In Progress, Done  | To Do, In Progress, Done  | Backlog, Sprint, In Progress, Review, Done |
| **Automation Features** | None                      | Auto-moves issues based on PR status, auto-closes completed issues | Auto-moves items through Sprint workflow, integrates with issues |
| **Agile Suitability** | Basic task tracking       | Good for continuous integration (CI/CD) | Best for Agile/Scrum teams using sprints |
| **Best Use Case**    | Simple task management    | Development workflows with automation | Agile teams following sprint-based development |

Each template serves different needs, with **Basic Kanban** offering simplicity, **Automated Kanban** streamlining development tasks, and **Scrum Board** providing structured Agile support.


## 3. Selected Template: Automated Custom Kanban with Reviews
### **Justification:**
- Included review column for better approval tracking. 
- Aligns with the **Sprint Plan** from Assignment 6.
- Provides a structured workflow for iterative development.
- Allows tracking of work from the backlog through sprints to completion.

## 4. Customisation Made
- Renamed columns to match the **Event Booking System** workflow.
- Linked **user stories** from Assignment 6 to the backlog.
- Created milestones for different sprints.
- Created new labels for the user stories. 


## 5. Conclusion
The ** Automated Custom Kanban with Reviews ** was chosen as it best aligns with the **backlog, sprint plan, and user stories** developed in Assignment 6, ensuring a structured Agile development process.
