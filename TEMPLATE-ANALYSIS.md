# Template Analysis: Choosing a GitHub Project Template

## 1. Overview
GitHub provides different project templates for managing workflows. For the Event Booking System, I evaluated the available templates and selected the most suitable one which was the Kanban Board.

## 2. Comparison of GitHub Project Templates

| Template | Features | Pros | Cons |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **Basic Kanban** | Simple columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) | Easy to use, minimal setup | Lacks advanced tracking features |
| **Automated Kanban** | Issues move automatically based on status changes | Reduces manual task movement | Can be restrictive if custom workflows are needed |
| **Automated Kanban with Reviews** | Includes review columns for better approval tracking | Useful for code review processes | More complex than needed for an event booking system |

## 3. Selected Template: Automated Custom Kanban with Reviews
### **Justification:**
- Included review column for better approval tracking. 
- Aligns with the **Sprint Plan** from Assignment 6.
- Provides a structured workflow for iterative development.
- Allows tracking of work from the backlog through sprints to completion.

## 4. Customisation Made
- Renamed columns to match the **Event Booking System** workflow.
- Linked **user stories** from Assignment 6 to the backlog.
- Created milestones for different sprints.
- Created new labels for the user stories. 


## 5. Conclusion
The ** Automated Custom Kanban with Reviews ** was chosen as it best aligns with the **backlog, sprint plan, and user stories** developed in Assignment 6, ensuring a structured Agile development process.
