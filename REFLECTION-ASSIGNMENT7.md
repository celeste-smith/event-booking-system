## Overview
In the beginning of starting this assignment, it became overwhelming as I have not worked on a Kanban Board before, particularly in GitHub. I realised after that it is very similar to a physical scrum or task board and with doing some research as to how the tool work in GitHub, I found it actually quite easy. In Assignment 6, I created the issues and soon realised that I needed to create the labels that was required that is not defaulted in GitHub to link it to the issues and the same went for the Milestones. And these I linked to my Project - Kanban Board. 

## Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template  
One of the main challenges in selecting a template for the GitHub Project board was ensuring it aligned with the workflow of the event booking system. While GitHub provides several default templates, such as **"Basic Kanban"** and **"Automated Kanban"**, I needed a template that aligned with Agile Scrum therefore customization was necessary to accommodate specific needs, such as:  

- **Adding a "Testing & Review" column** to account for the QA phase before marking tasks as complete.  
- **Defining task priorities and statuses** clearly to ensure better visibility of ongoing work.  

| Feature            | GitHub Projects        | Trello                | Jira                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| **Integration**   | Best for GitHub repos  | Standalone, but integrates with other tools  | Great for complex workflows (Scrum, Kanban) |
| **Customization** | Allows column edits, labels, and automation | Highly customizable, but less automation | Advanced workflows with deep customization |
| **Ease of Use**   | Moderate (learning curve for setup) | Very user-friendly | Can be complex for beginners |
| **Best For**      | Developers using GitHub | Simple task tracking | Large teams, enterprise projects |


- **Trello** is the easiest to use but lacks deep GitHub integration.  
- **Jira** is ideal for **enterprise-level** teams managing sprints, but it can be overcomplicated for smaller projects.  
- **GitHub Projects** is the best option for **developers working directly with GitHub Issues**, making it an ideal choice for version control and continuous development workflows.  

Ultimately, GitHub Projects was chosen because of its **seamless GitHub Issue linking, automation options, and direct integration with code repositories**, making it the most efficient tool for this assignment.
