## 1. Overview
In the beginning of starting this assignment, it became overwhelming as I have not worked on a Kanban Board before, particularly in GitHub. I realised after that it is very similar to a physical scrum or task board and with doing some research as to how the tool work in GitHub, I found it actually quite easy. In Assignment 6, I created the issues and soon realised that I needed to create the labels that was required that is not defaulted in GitHub to link it to the issues and the same went for the Milestones. And these I linked to my Project - Kanban Board. 

### Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template  
One of the main challenges in selecting a template for the GitHub Project board was ensuring it aligned with the workflow of the event booking system. While GitHub provides several default templates, such as **"Basic Kanban"** and **"Automated Kanban"**, I needed a template that aligned with Agile Scrum therefore customization was necessary to accommodate specific needs, such as:  

- **Adding a "Testing & Review" column** to account for the QA phase before marking tasks as complete.  
- **Defining task priorities and statuses** clearly to ensure better visibility of ongoing work.
