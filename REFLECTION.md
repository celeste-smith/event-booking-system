# Reflection on Project Templates and Kanban Board Implementation - Assignment 7

## Overview
In the beginning of starting this assignment, it became overwhelming as I have not worked on a Kanban Board before, particularly in GitHub. I realised after that it is very similar to a physical scrum or task board and with doing some research as to how the tool work in GitHub, I found it actually quite easy. In Assignment 6, I created the issues and soon realised that I needed to create the labels that was required that is not defaulted in GitHub to link it to the issues and the same went for the Milestones. And these I linked to my Project - Kanban Board. 

## Challenges in Selecting and Customizing the Template  
One of the main challenges in selecting a template for the GitHub Project board was ensuring it aligned with the workflow of the event booking system. While GitHub provides several default templates, such as **"Basic Kanban"** and **"Automated Kanban"**, I needed a template that aligned with Agile Scrum therefore customization was necessary to accommodate specific needs, such as:  

- **Adding a "Testing & Review" column** to account for the QA phase before marking tasks as complete.  
- **Defining task priorities and statuses** clearly to ensure better visibility of ongoing work.  

| Feature            | GitHub Projects        | Trello                | Jira                   |
|--------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| **Integration**   | Best for GitHub repos  | Standalone, but integrates with other tools  | Great for complex workflows (Scrum, Kanban) |
| **Customization** | Allows column edits, labels, and automation | Highly customizable, but less automation | Advanced workflows with deep customization |
| **Ease of Use**   | Moderate (learning curve for setup) | Very user-friendly | Can be complex for beginners |
| **Best For**      | Developers using GitHub | Simple task tracking | Large teams, enterprise projects |


- **Trello** is the easiest to use but lacks deep GitHub integration.  
- **Jira** is ideal for **enterprise-level** teams managing sprints, but it can be overcomplicated for smaller projects.  
- **GitHub Projects** is the best option for **developers working directly with GitHub Issues**, making it an ideal choice for version control and continuous development workflows.  

Ultimately, GitHub Projects was chosen because of its **seamless GitHub Issue linking, automation options, and direct integration with code repositories**, making it the most efficient tool for this assignment.



# Reflection on Agile Planning Challenges - Assignment 6

## Introduction
Transitioning from traditional requirement gathering to Agile planning introduces several challenges. As the sole stakeholder in this assignment, I encountered difficulties in prioritising tasks, estimating effort, and aligning Agile methodology with system development.

## 1. Prioritisation Challenges
The challenges was deciding which features should be included in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). While search and booking functionalities were essential, other features like reporting and system monitoring seemed important but not urgent. Using the **MoSCoW prioritization** method helped break down features into Must-have, Should-have, and Could-have categories. This ensured that implementation of the most critical functionalities can happen first. 

## 2. Effort Estimation Difficulties
Estimating effort in story points was a bit difficult since I had no prior data on development time for each task. I applied the **Fibonacci sequence (1, 2, 3, 5, 8)** to assign story points, keeping estimates relative rather than absolute. For future iterations, tracking actual development time will help refine these estimates.


## 3. Balancing Technical vs. User-Centric Stories
Security and performance requirements (e.g., data encryption, handling 1000 concurrent users) are crucial but does not immediately add visible user value. To balance this, I included at least one **non-functional user story** in the backlog per sprint, ensuring security and performance improvements while focusing on user-facing features.

## 4. Aligning Agile with Stakeholder Needs
Since I play multiple roles (Product Owner, Developer, and Stakeholder), it was difficult to objectively validate priorities. I simulated stakeholder feedback by considering real-world concerns, such as user experience, system reliability, and ease of event management.

## Conclusion
Despite these challenges, Agile planning provided a structured approach to feature development. Refining prioritisation, estimation, and balancing functional vs. technical stories will be key to improving future sprints. I also ended up learning some new things from GitHub based on this assignment. 



# Reflections for Assignment 5

## Introduction
Translating system requirements into structured use cases and test cases is a critical step in software development. However, for those new to the process, several challenges can arise. These challenges impact the accuracy, completeness, and effectiveness of the final system. This document explores key difficulties and strategies to overcome them.

## 1. Understanding the Level of Detail Needed
I was not sure what the appropriate level of detail for use cases and test cases which is where I struggled with. I tried to clarify by using step by step descriptions. 

## 2. Handling Alternative and Exception Flows
When I started the Use Case Specifications, I ignored error scenarios and added alternate flows afterwards.

## Conclusion
Translating requirements into use cases and test cases requires careful planning and attention to detail. I do have an idea or some type of experience in creating use and test cases.
