# Reflection on Assignment 8

## 1. Challenges in Choosing Granularity for States/Actions
A challenge I had with assignment 8 was when choosing granularity for states and actions was finding the balance between too much detail and readability. My thoughts were that I do not want to make the diagrams too cluttered and difficult for interpretation by adding too many details, especially for stakeholders who might not have a technical background. I also thought that if I skip on too many details, then the chance of important processes being missed is a possibility which could probably lead to misunderstanding of how the system must behave. 

## 2. Aligning Diagrams with Agile User Stories
Aligning the diagrams with Agile user stories was another challenge. Agile focuses on flexibility and incremental progress, which meant that the diagrams I created needed to be flexible an adaptable to changes.

## 3. Comparing State Diagrams vs. Activity Diagrams
Each diagram had a distinct role in conveying system behavior. The state diagram focused more on the states an object can be in and the transitions that occur based on actions, providing a clear view of the object's lifecycle and activity diagrams illustrated the flow of activities or processes across different actions. 
Overall, working with these diagrams taught me how to balance technical detail with clarity while staying aligned with user stories. I learned that each type of diagram has its strengths and serves a different purpose in understanding the system's behavior and processes.
