##Business Rules

- A **User** must be registered to make a **Booking**.
- An **Event** can only be booked if `status = Active` and `capacity > 0`.
- Each **Booking** must be linked to a valid **Payment**.
- A **User** can only cancel a **Booking** if the **Event** is still upcoming.
- An **Admin** can create or cancel **Events**.
- A **Ticket** is generated only after **Payment** is successful.
- Notifications are sent on actions like booking confirmation, cancellations, and event changes.
